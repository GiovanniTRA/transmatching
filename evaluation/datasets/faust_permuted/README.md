# FAUST permuted

This is a safety check evaluation dataset, the performance must match the plain faust dataset!

Evaluation dataset generated from the original un-processed shape from FAUST, but the **ground truth matching  is not the identity**.

- There 100 pairs of random shapes from FAUST, s.t. `A != B`
- Each shape has 6890 vertices

The original id of the shapes can be retrieved from the `meta.json` file.
